## 17.10.2017

* Finished working on lasers.
* Made dynamic laser intesity based on distance from ship.
* Made laser destroy based on distance from player and if it collided with  a ship.
* Added a "header file". Note: In C# i'm using a namespace rather then a header file, as I do not want to mess with .dll files as it can be time-consuming and, to be honest, it's just easier copying a .cs file rather then compiling a .dll and importing it.

* Compiled all 6 images into skybox.
